The single seam for host-based tenant routing. Today a tenant lives at
one subdomain of BASE_DOMAIN; a custom-domain tier would add a branch
here and nowhere else, which is the whole reason host parsing is
confined to this module.

With BASE_DOMAIN unset — the default, and what the test suite and any
single-host deployment run with — every host is the base domain and no
host resolves to a tenant, so host routing is inert.

    the option at all. Two conditions, both required:

    `EMBED_HOST` is the deployment's capability. Without an origin of
    its own there is nowhere safe to run a third-party snippet, so no
    workspace can embed however it was sold.

    `EMBED_TENANTS` is the commercial entitlement. Membership is by
    subdomain, which is the tenant identifier that survives being
    written down in an environment variable -- a primary key would not
    survive a restore into a fresh database.

    A tenant of None is not entitled. That is the honest answer for the
    base domain and for a deployment with no tenant rows, and it also
    means a single-host install must name its workspace in
