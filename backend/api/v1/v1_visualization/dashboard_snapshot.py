# Dashboard publish: the snapshot, both directions (VIZ-007)
# =========================================================
# Publish freezes what a dashboard renders; the read namespace serves
# that frozen copy, checked against live rows as it goes out. Both
# directions live in one module so the shape written and the shape read
# cannot drift apart.
#
# Plain functions over dicts, like dashboard_functions.py. Nothing here
# touches a request or a response.

    `default_filters` travels with the widgets (spec D-1). The rule is
    "does editing this change the picture?": retuning the filter bar
    changes the numbers on screen exactly as moving a widget does, so
    both wait for Publish. Identity — name, slug, root_form — is
    deliberately absent, because a corrected typo in a title should not
    require re-publishing work that is not finished.

    The ordering is stated here rather than inherited from
    `DashboardWidget.Meta.ordering`: this is the artefact viewers read,
    and its order must not depend on a Meta attribute a later change
    could quietly reorder.

    """Copy each widget with `is_broken` / `broken_reason` set.

    Spec D-5. The obvious query here is
    `filter(deleted_at__isnull=False)`. This does the inverse: it asks
    which referenced ids are *live and belong to this tenant*, and
    treats everything else as broken. That catches three failure modes
    where the obvious one catches a single case — soft-deleted (the
    common case), hard-deleted (no row left to read `deleted_at` from),
    and an id belonging to another tenant. The last should be
    unreachable, since the family was validated at save time, but a
    snapshot is a copy taken at a point in time and this is the one
    place where such a copy meets live rows.

    Scoped by tenant rather than by user because this runs for
    anonymous readers too. `for_user` would hand an anonymous caller
    the tenant-less queryset, mark every widget on a public dashboard
    broken, and render the whole page as an error — a failure that
    looks like data loss rather than like a missing permission.

    Two queries, both flat in widget count. The result is a new list;
    the caller's snapshot is never mutated, because it is a row from
    the database that nobody meant to write back.
