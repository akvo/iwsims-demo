# Dashboard builder: save-time rules (VIZ-005)
# =========================================================
# Under file-based configs a human reviewed every dashboard before it
# shipped. Under tenant-authored ones nobody will, so every rule in
# VIZ-001 §4.5 is enforced here, before a row is written: a dashboard
# that saves is a dashboard that renders.
#
# Everything in this module is plain functions over dicts. The viewset
# turns what they return into HTTP; nothing here imports DRF.
