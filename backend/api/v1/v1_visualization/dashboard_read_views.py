# =========================================================
# The read namespace: /dashboards (VIZ-007)
# =========================================================
# What a viewer sees, as opposed to what an author edits. Separate from
# DashboardBuilderViewSet because every axis differs: the queryset is
# narrowed to published, the lookup is the slug, the permission is a
# token and nothing more, and the widgets come from the snapshot rather
# than the live rows.
#
# Keeping it a class of its own also keeps the security boundary
# readable: one queryset, unconditionally narrowed, with no action able
# to widen it.
#
# Anonymous readers are the point of this namespace (spec D-3), CLEANUP-
# 001 notwithstanding: that removal was of the previous public
# dashboard, which let an anonymous caller name any form id it liked.
# get_queryset() below is the boundary that replaces it — narrowed to
# published rows unconditionally, and widened only by who is asking.
