# =========================================================
# The anonymous boundary for public dashboards
# =========================================================
# CLEANUP-001 removed the previous public dashboard because an
# anonymous caller could name any form id it liked and walk other
# tenants' aggregates. The rule that replaces it: an anonymous caller
# names one dashboard, and may ask only about the ids that dashboard's
# own published snapshot already names.
#
# What an anonymous request may see, once it has a tenant, lives in
# this module: which dashboard, and which of that dashboard's ids. The
# anonymous TENANT decision does not live here -- that is
# `utils/tenant_host.py:public_tenant`, which this module calls rather
# than reimplements. And this module is not anonymous-only: its
# `has_any_dashboard_access` decides what an AUTHENTICATED caller may
# see in the private dashboard dropdown.
