# =========================================================
# Dashboard builder: /manage/dashboards (VIZ-005)
# =========================================================
# Mirrors FormBuilderViewSet (FB-002): the queryset is scoped with
# for_user() so no action can reach a row outside the caller's tenant,
# and permissions come from a per-action map rather than a check
# scattered through each method.
#
# No pagination_class. VIZ-001 §6 says "paginated", but both merged
# consumers do Array.isArray(res.data) ? res.data : [], and
# DashboardBuilder resolves slug -> id by scanning the whole list, so
# an envelope would break the builder silently. See the spec, D-1.
